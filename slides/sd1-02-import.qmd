# Importing

Working through our first notebook

## Libraries

Libraries are a collections of pre-written functions that we download to our computer so we can us them in our code.

The [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) has several libraries that are designed to work together, like [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) to manipulate data, and [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to make charts.
