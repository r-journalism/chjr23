## Install R & RStudio

You'll need to go to `https://posit.co/downloads/` and click on the big **Download RStudio** button there. There are two parts:

1. Install the R language
2. Install the RStudio Desktop program

Make sure you run the installer or copy into your Applications folder as noted.

The R language gets installed on your machine, but you never launch it like a regular program.

## Install Quarto

1. Go to `quarto.org/` and then click the **Getting Started** link.
2. Download and install the software for your machine.

## Launch RStudio

1. From your Applications folder (or through your Start menu) launch the program called RStudio

## About RStudio Desktop

We'll orient a bit in class.

## Look for the console

We need you to run some commands in the RStudio **Console**. We'll provide code to copy/paste.

### Install packages

This will take some time to run, depending on the internet.

```r
install.packages(c("usethis", "tidyverse", "quarto", "rmarkdown", "janitor"))
```

### Download, open the material

As you are asked questions, choose the default answers or ones that make the most sense.

```r
usethis::use_course("https://github.com/r-journalism/chjr/archive/master.zip")
```

## Using projects

R needs to know where things live on your computer so it can find them.

We use **projects** to organize our work. One folder for each project, with everything you need.

## Open our first lesson

1. In the **Files** pane, find our first file in `lessons/d1-01-intro.qmd` and open it.
2. This should open in your pane to the left, with the Console below it.

We'll work from there now.
