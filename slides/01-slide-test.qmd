# How this works

## Can view online

These slides get published to Docs and we can use them online from Github Pages. Plenty O' features with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/).

## Can also render locally

Students have the slides and can render locally, but not at same time as documents.

# In the evening

## Dinner

- Eat spaghetti
- Drink wine

## Going to sleep

- Get in bed
- Count sheep
