# Keyboard commands

Learning keyboard shortcuts can make you a more efficient coder.

You can find a list of all the shortcuts at **Tools â†’ Keyboard Shortcuts Help**.

Another way to find a menu item (and to learn its keyboard equivalent) is with the **Help** menu. Just type in the menu item and it will show you where it is.
