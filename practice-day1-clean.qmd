title: "Practice Day 1"
---

This is the notebook fellows will work through on the first day of the Center for Health Journalism Hands-On R course.

You will be using daily weather summaries that have been downloaded  from [Climate Data Online](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets). The explanations use Texas, but there are files for Arkansas, California, New York and North Carolina for practice.

## Goals

Our goals are to:

- Import our data.
- Check all the column data types.
- Add some new columns based on the date.
- Recode some values in our data.
- Remove some unnecessary variables/columns.
- Export our cleaned data.

## Setup

Add the entire code block for libraries.

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

## Import

Follow the directions in the lesson to import the Texas data, starting with adding a new code block:



### OYO: Import a different state

Go through all the steps above, but with different a different state.



## Peeking at data

Use head, tail, glimpse and summary to look at the Texas data.

Look at the top of your data:


Look at 8 lines of the bottom of your data:


Use glimpse to see all your columns:


Use summary to learn about all your variables:


### OYO: Peek at your state's data

Use those same functions above to look at your state's data.

## Create or change data

Create year, month values based on the date. This is a multi-step process:



### OYO: Make date parts

Make the same date parts, but with your own state data:


## Recoding values

Use distinct so you can see the station names:


Use recode to create a new column of short city names:


Now check your results using distinct on `name` and `city`:


### OYO: Recode your cities

Make similar short names, but for your state.


## Select

Create a new version of your data with only the columns you need, in the order you want them:


### OYO: Select your cols

Go through the same process as above to select columns with your own state data.



## Export

Write the file out as "rds" to the `data-processed` folder:


### OYO: Export your state

Write your data to the `data-processed` folder. Make sure you use a name for your state.


## Checking your notebooks

Clear out your notebook and rerun all the code. Render the HTML page.
