title: "Practice Day 2"
---

## Goals

To learn about: arrange, filter, slice, group_by, summarize

To find several values from our data:

- The coldest and warmest days
- The rainiest and snowiest days
- Years with most snow days
- Years with most 100+ days
- Years with most rain
- Earliest day to reach 100+ each year

With this lesson we'll just use Texas data. (You theoretically could use a different state, but would need to adjust your code to import the right data, use valid cities, etc.)
