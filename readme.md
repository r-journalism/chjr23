# CHJR 2023

Lessons for the 2023 version of the Center for Health Journalism's Data Fellowship.

With these lessons we'll learn about:

- Basics of R, RStudio and Quarto
- Importing, cleaning and exporting data
- Basic data wrangling
- working with text
- Shaping data
- Visualizing data
- Project management

## Installing the software

You need to have both R and RStudio Desktop installed on your computer. Hopefully this is already done.

- You can find the [installers here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). You need both R and RStudio.
- If on a Mac, make sure you install RStudio into your Applications folder.

There is a chance we might have to install [Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), but don't worry about it unless we need it. If we have challenges wih Macs installing xcode-cli tools, [I have a copy here](https://utexas.box.com/s/mkurzwclt4fvoy0h6jhprtecwmidzzs3).

## Download this repo

Now we'll download the course materials for the first couple of days of class. They are stored on Github.

1. Go to the repo on Github: [github.com/r-journalism/chjr23](https://github.com/r-journalism/chjr23)
2. Click on the big green Code button and choose **Download zip**.
3. Find the downloaded file and unzip the folder. Mac: Double-click on it. [PC directions here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5)
4. Move the unzipped folder to your Desktop (or some other place you can find it).
5. Go back to RStudio and go to **File > Open Project**. Go find your folder and open the file `chjr23.Rproj`.
