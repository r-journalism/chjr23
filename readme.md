# CHJR Part 1

With these lessons we'll learn about:

- Basics of R, RStudio and Quarto
- Importing, cleaning and exporting data
- Basic data wrangling
- Project management

## Install R and RStudio

- You can find the [installers here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). You need both R and RStudio.
    - If on a Mac, make sure you move RStudio into your Applications folder.

There is a chance we might have to install [Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), but don't worry about it unless we need it.


## Download this repo

Now we'll download the course materials for the first couple of days of class. They are stored on Github.

1. From this page, click on the big green **Code** button and choose **Download zip**
3. Find the downloaded file and unzip the folder. Mac: Double-click on it. [PC directions here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5)
4. Move the unzipped folder to your Desktop (or some other place you can find it).
5. Go back to RStudio and go to File > Open Project. Go find your folder and open the file `chjr-part1.Rproj`.

## Lessons

We'll use web-published versions of the lessons to read as we work through practice notebooks in the project.
